# setting up
To set up the project you need first pull the project, then perform git submodule update --init --recursive to set up the external libraries.
Currently, there are four branches in this project.\
The project is first developed as a cpp project and then converted into a SYCL project the purpose is to outline the difference between traditional programming and sycl programming and how to convert existing CPP projects to SYCL ones. At the end of this project, I hope the code can be compiled in a traditional CPP compiler and SYCL compiler.   




# rayTracer
Aim 13/09/2023 get ride of Embree\
Future aim rewrite the code in sycl:\
<del> *TODO* Change the recursive to iteration</del> \
<del> *TODO* rewrite inheritance using [link](https://developer.codeplay.com/products/computecpp/ce/2.11.0/guides/sycl-guide/limitations)</del>
